- one function that represents the computer's play randomly returning R P or s
- one function playing a round, taking the computer's play and player's play and deciding, then declaring the winner.
    - the player's play need to be case-insensitive (rock, ROCK, or RocK)
    - this should return results, not console.log() them
- one function that represents one full game that plays 5 rounds and reports the winner
    - this should console.log() the result of each round and the winner at the end
- at some points prompt() user for their play

first function, computerPlay:
    - no parameters, 'function computerPlay()'
    - how to randomly return one of three strings? maybe use a random number generator of sorts?
        - function getRandomNum() - use Math.random() with Math.floor() to generate either 0, 1, or 2
        - then use a conditional to return one of the strings based on the generated number'
        - code for getRandomNum adapted from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
